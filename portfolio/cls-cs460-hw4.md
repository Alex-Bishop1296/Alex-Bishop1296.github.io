# Notes

# 1 & 2.[Setup & Planning] 
For this project I started by making a MVC project in Visual Studio. Before making any major commits, I branched my repostory into hw-four and made changes to my .gitignore. I decided to use a template off the web to avoid including any of the many MVC files I did not know much about. I chose to stay on my hw-four branch for now instead of branching into my first feature branch to allow the homepage to be relatively consistent between the two branchs.

# 3 - 5.[Coding and Content]
For starters, we needed to make a Home/Landing page for this assignment. When the default project was generated by visual studio, most of the landing page format was ready to go but needed some changes. Let's start by looking at the code for the end of my project:

![Code for Homepage](example/hw4ex/indexCode.PNG)

Breaking this down, the start of the page opens with a Viewbag. This is a dynamic ASP.NET MVC property of ControllerBase class which is the base class of all the controllers.You can assign any number of properties and values to ViewBag. If you assign the same property name multiple times to ViewBag, then it will only consider last value assigned to the property. Here we really only use it for the title of this view (the actual CSHTML) of our site. Below it we have Bootstrap html elements for a Jumbotron and two rows containing text and buttons. Most of these items were is place by default so I won't discuss, but this page raises the question when we look at the final result. The view is shown as the image below:

![webpage displaying Home View](example/hw4ex/homeView.PNG)

We can see that elements not in that homepage view code are on the homepage view, such as the navbar and footer. Well, these elements are shared between webpages, so they are actually held in a layout file. Let's look at that file right now:

![_layout code 1](example/hw4ex/layout1.PNG)
![_layout code 2](example/hw4ex/layout2.PNG)

I have only include the parts of the code here where I made edits, ie the navbar and the footer.
