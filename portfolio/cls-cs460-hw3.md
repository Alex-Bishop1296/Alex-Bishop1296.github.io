# Notes

# 1 & 2.[Setup] 
Setup for this project was just having visual studio community 2017 installed, as I had already done before in the past their was noting else to do for this step. I simply downloaded the java files and started to translate them as I will detail below.

# 3.[Planning and Design]
Let me go over some of the concepts I learn pouring over the java code. The first thing The first node file contains the class with the public scope Node<T>. The <T> is a type parameter (also called type variables) that can be used A type variable can be any non-primitive type you specify: any class type, any interface type, any array type, or even another type variable. This same technique can be applied to create generic interfaces.
