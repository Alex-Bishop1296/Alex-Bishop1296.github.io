### Who am I?
I'm currently a senior at Western Oregon University preparing to graduate with my bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a minor in Math. I have had experience in Code Oregano's training program and the internship program at Huron medical consulting. I have had a lot of experience over the years in programming, and I'm ready to show the world what I've got.
